## Block fields
| Field | Explanation | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Name](#name) | This is a unique name of your Block. Sketchware uses this to identify different Blocks. This field should not be the same as other blocks. | Yes |
| [Type](#type) | Please enter value according to your block code(Eg. Void,If-then,If-else etc). | Yes |
| [Type Name](#type-name) | Read [Type Name](#type-name) | If [Type](#type) is `p` then this field is required. |

### Name
This is a unique name for a block. Sketchware pro uses this as the id of the block. If you use a Block in a project then Sketchware pro will use this property to identify each block and its code. This property cannot be the same for other blocks because it may cause errors.
### Type
Study the below data.
- regular

### Type Name
This field is not required until the [Type Name](#type-name) is `c`.
This property tells Sketchware pro that the block is related to a component that is defined in the **Type Name** property.
