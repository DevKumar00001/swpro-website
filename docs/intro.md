## Features

- Custom Blocks: The Pro version allows users to create, use and share custom blocks.
- Local Library: This feature allows developers to download and use local libraries in their projects.
- No Ads: The Pro version does not contain ads and is free to use.
- Additional Components: There are various extra components added in the pro version such as Google Login, Notification, Phone Auth, Rewarded Video Ad and more.
- Kotlin Code Support: The most significant new feature of this release is Kotlin code support! Compiling Kotlin code still needs an Android 8+ device though, so only the -minApi26 version supports Kotlin.
