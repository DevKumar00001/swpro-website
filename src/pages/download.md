# What's new
In short,
<ul>
<li>Reading debug logs from projects. A new activity for that, the Logcat Reader, was added, and to start seeing logs there, run your project and open the Logcat Reader in Sketchware Pro.</li>
<li>Symbol pair auto-completion in the code editor can now be turned off.</li>
<li>Upgrade to sora-editor v0.14.0.</li>
<li>Upgrade to Iyxan23/zipalign-java:96fd6b30c928015847264b27b0d2dd407f3e8895.</li>
<li>Some performance improvements to the DEX merging step.</li>
<li>Using resource strings in the text and hint property of Views now works! Set e.g. @string/greeting as text or hint, and the View code will use the resource string, not escape the @.</li>
<li>You can now tweak the filename of SWB backups.</li>
</ul>
