### Documentation updated

At first, they have added links to docs in the app. Although there are more docs on this website, they will not be added.

### Java 11 support

Sketchware Pro now supports Java 11. That means you can now develop more cool and complex apps. It only works in minApi26, sadly.

### Syntax highlighting

Editing Kotlin and XML code was a mess earlier. Now it's getting better and cleaner with syntax highlighting for XML and Kotlin.

### Help them improve

You can now finnaly send crashlogs directly from the app instead of joining there Discord server.

### Auto-installer

If your device has **Root access**, then Sketchware Pro can automatically install compiled apks, instead of opening android's package manager.

### Inject just got better

ou can now use e.g. `tools:replace="android:id"` in a View's inject property to remove android:id from its XML code. This is a replacement for XML Command Blocks that change tiny things like these.

Projects using Google maps work now. bundletool(1.11.3), sora-editor(0.17.2), Firebase Realtime Database(19.3.1), built-in material library(1.6.1), r8(3.3.75), and Kotlinc(1.7.10) also got updated.
